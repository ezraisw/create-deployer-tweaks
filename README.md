# Create Deployer Tweaks

These tweaks are taken from [Create Enchantment Industry](https://github.com/DragonsPlusMinecraft/CreateEnchantmentIndustry-Fabric). For those that want the Deployer changes without the CEI's other stuff.
- Allow Deployer to drop XP on mob kills.
- Allow Deployer to use dropped XP if the currently used tool has Mending.
- Allow swords on Deployer to take advantage of sweeping edge.
